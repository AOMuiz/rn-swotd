# Wordle Game in React Native

## Todo

- Save current progress in AsyncStorage, so that if we close the App, we can continue.

- Keep track of the stats:

  - number of games played
  - win rate
  - current streak
  - max streak

- Animations

More advance (needs some backend):

- save the stats in a database
- public dashboard
