## A brief description of the project

### Features

- Guess the `scientific word of the day` (SWOTD)

- Share your guess on social media

- Save current progress in AsyncStorage, so that if we close the App, we can continue.

- Keep track of the stats:

  - number of games played
  - win rate
  - current streak
  - max streak

- Animations

More advance (needs some backend):

- save the stats in a database
- public dashboard

### Technologies Used

1. Implemented app navigation with `react-navigation`.

2. Used `react-native-AsyncStorage` for storage.
